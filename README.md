# Jira Ticket Summariser
## Context
When teams want to look at recent tickets in their jira board to compare and contrast what a current issue should fall under it can be difficult to find a card with similar size.

## To Configure
To run this project please change the following variables at the top of the index.js file:
- emailAddress
- apiKey
- atlassianUrl
- projectCode

FYI: apikey can be generated by going to Atlassian Account > Security > API Token


To better configure the printouts change:
- seeCardUrls (true to have clickable hyperlinks, false to just see cards keys)
- numberOfIssuesToPrint (vary the number which are printed out)
- storyPointsUsed (fibonacci has been set as the default but im aware other teams use other items )


## To run
You will need npm and node.
```
git clone https://github.com/christophperrins/jira-ticket-summeriser.git
cd jira-ticket-summeriser
npm install
node index.js
```
